/**
 * On-demand video ingestion diagnostics.
 *
 * `/reels` renders six curated clips and no scraped video, and the cause was
 * invisible: the feed logs `scraper returned no videos` both when the endpoint
 * has nothing and when the ingestion is broken. The scraper's own ingestion was
 * only reachable by an admin pressing a button, so nobody could tell whether it
 * had ever run.
 *
 * `?trigger=0` reads without ingesting, which is how the result of a previous run
 * is observed: the scraper may ingest asynchronously, so reading in the same
 * breath as the trigger can legitimately return the older list.
 *
 * The scheduled half of this runs from `/api/cron/sync`, which already holds the
 * cron slot — see `src/lib/video-sync.ts` and the `Video` table note in
 * docs/TODO.md.
