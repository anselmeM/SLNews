/**
 * The Clerk Frontend API origin, derived from the publishable key.
 *
 * A publishable key is `pk_<env>_<base64(frontendApiHost + "$")>` — the third
 * underscore-separated segment decodes to the host ClerkJS actually talks to
 * (e.g. `optimal-shepherd-5919.clerk.accounts.dev`, or `clerk.slnews.sl` on a
 * production instance with its own-domain Frontend API).
 *
 * Deriving it means the Content-Security-Policy in `next.config.ts` always
 * matches whichever instance is configured. Hardcoding a host instead leaves a
 * policy that silently blocks ClerkJS the moment the keys change — and that
 * happens in production, during the one change where debugging is hardest.
 *
 * Build-time only: used by `next.config.ts`.
 *
 * @returns e.g. `"https://clerk.slnews.sl"`, or `null` when the key is absent or
 *   malformed (callers should then fall back to the static Clerk origins).
